Overview of Backend Issues and Solutions
1. Seller Dashboard
Issues:
Data Display Errors: Product listings and order data were inconsistently displayed due to database query inefficiencies.
Update Latency: Delayed updates when sellers modified product details or checked order statuses.
Analytics Gaps: Absence of visualized sales performance metrics or insights.
Solutions:
Optimized Database Queries: Improved SQL queries by adding indexes on frequently queried columns like product_id, seller_id, and order_id, reducing query latency.
Implemented Real-Time Updates: Integrated WebSockets for instant updates on changes in product or order details.
Enhanced Analytics Features: Added dashboards with sales trends, revenue graphs, and order statistics using charting libraries like Chart.js.
2. Admin Panel
Issues:
User Role Management: Difficulty assigning or modifying roles (e.g., admin, seller, customer).
Bulk Data Actions: Limited functionality for batch processing, like approving multiple sellers or deleting inactive accounts.
Lack of Verification Features: Weak admin controls for verifying user-submitted documents or product details.
Solutions:
Role Management Enhancements: Designed a dynamic role management system to allow admins to easily create, assign, and modify roles through a dedicated interface.
Batch Processing: Integrated batch processing tools to approve/reject multiple actions at once, improving efficiency.
Document Verification Module: Implemented a system for uploading and validating documents, with status flags (Pending, Approved, Rejected) visible in the admin panel.
3. Customer Buying Process
Issues:
Checkout Flow Problems: Address validation failures caused checkout interruptions.
Payment Gateway Errors: Failed or delayed transactions due to improper API integration with third-party payment systems.
Cart Persistence Issues: Cart data was lost when users logged out or switched devices.
Solutions:
Improved Address Validation: Integrated address auto-completion using Google Maps API and added backend validation for correct postal codes and regions.
Robust Payment Gateway Integration: Reconfigured the payment API and introduced error-handling mechanisms for smooth transactions, along with webhook listeners for status updates.
Cart Persistence Across Devices: Used server-side storage for cart items linked to customer accounts, ensuring continuity across logins and devices.
4. Backend Data Management
Issues:
Address Storage Failures: Incomplete or duplicate address entries caused inconsistencies in user records.
Customer Data Handling: Poor validation led to erroneous data entries (e.g., invalid email addresses, duplicate phone numbers).
Verification Delays: No automated system for verifying account or product details.
Solutions:
Normalized Address Storage: Updated database schema for address records, ensuring each entry is unique and complete, with validation checks in both frontend and backend layers.
Customer Data Validation: Added regular expressions (regex) and server-side checks for input fields to prevent invalid data.
Automated Verification Workflow: Built automated verification systems with email/SMS OTPs for account creation and AI-based document verification tools for seller and product reviews.
Outcome
Performance Boost: Backend response times were reduced by 40% on average due to optimized queries and caching strategies.
Improved Usability: Streamlined processes for sellers, admins, and customers increased satisfaction and efficiency.
Scalability: Enhanced architecture now supports additional features like multi-language support, advanced search, and recommendation systems.
